# Reports viewer

This project is my internship in university.  
The task is to create app that parsing data from .xlsx tables and Google tables and combines it
into a general report and displaying it in convenient form.  
Stack of the tools:
* Vue.js
  * Vuetify
  * Vue-router
* Node.js
* Maybe another tool that can help with parsing Google tables 
* Maybe another useful plugin for Vue (like Vuex)
